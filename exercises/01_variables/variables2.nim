# Description: Work with different types of variables and basic operations.
# Hint: Remember that Nim is statically typed. Ensure your variable types match the assigned values. For numeric types, you can perform standard arithmetic operations. For strings, `&` is used for concatenation.

# Task 1: Fix the type mismatch.
var count: string = 100 # This should be an integer.
# echo count # Uncomment when fixed.

# Task 2: Declare a floating-point variable `pi` and assign it the value 3.14159. Print it.

# Task 3: Declare two integer variables, `a` and `b`, assign them values,
#         and print their sum.

# Task 4: Declare a string variable `greeting` with the value "Nim is "
#         and another string variable `adj` with the value "awesome".
#         Concatenate them and print the result.

# ValidationScript: validate_variables2.nims

# Note: The validation script will check for the presence of expected outputs.
# Make sure your program prints:
# - The number 100 (after fixing Task 1)
# - The number 3.14159
# - The sum of two integers
# - The string "Nim is awesome"
