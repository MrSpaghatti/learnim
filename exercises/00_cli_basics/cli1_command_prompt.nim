# Description: Understanding the command prompt and running Nimlings.
# Hint: You are interacting with Nimlings through a command-line interface (CLI). You type commands after the prompt (like `$` or `C:\>`). For Nimlings, you'll use commands like `nimlings list` or `nimlings run <exercise_name>`.

# This exercise is informational. To complete it, simply make the program compile.
# The `echo` statement below is already correct.

# The command line is a powerful way to interact with your computer.
# Nimlings itself is a command-line program!

# To run this exercise, you would type:
# nimlings run cli1_command_prompt

# Or, if you are using watch mode:
# nimlings watch (it might pick this one up if it's next)

echo "Understanding the CLI is the first step!"

# ExpectedOutput: Understanding the CLI is the first step!
