# Description: Learn about listing files, like how `nimlings list` shows exercises.
# Hint: In many command-line environments, `ls` (Linux/macOS) or `dir` (Windows) are used to list files in a directory. Nimlings has its own `list` command to show you available exercises.

# This exercise is informational.
# The goal is to understand that commands can show you lists of things.

# To see all Nimlings exercises, you type:
# nimlings list

# For this exercise, make the program echo the name of the command that lists Nimlings exercises.
var nimlingsListCommand: string

# TODO: Assign the correct Nimlings command to the variable above.
# nimlingsListCommand = "???"

echo "To see all Nimlings exercises, use: ", nimlingsListCommand

# ExpectedOutput: To see all Nimlings exercises, use: nimlings list
